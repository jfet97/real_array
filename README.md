# real_array
   

What is this? This is a new, never seen, useless container. 
real_array is like a normal array, but with one difference: to access to the n-th element of the array tou have to use [n] instead of [n-1]. What? Yes you have understood perfectly...we say enough to range errors!
<br>
<br>What can I do? You can do whatever you want. This template class provide all common methods like: size, front, back, at and others. It provides iterators, exceptions for wrong indexing, and useful operator overloading. You can also initialize a real_array using initializer_list. Run examples.cpp to see some examples.
<br>   
<br>Note that jfet::real_array transfers its constness to the contained objects
<br>    
<br>P.S. you can use:
<ul>
	<li>jfet::char_array instead of jfet::real_array<char></li>
	<li>jfet::string_array instead of jfet::real_array<std::string></li>
	<li>jfet::int_array instead of jfet::real_array<int></li>
	<li>jfet::float_array instead of jfet::real_array<float></li>
	<li>jfet::double_array instead of jfet::real_array<double></li>
</ul>
