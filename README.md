# real_array
   

What is this? This is a new, never seen, useless container.<br>
real_array is like a normal array, but with one difference: to access to the n-th element of the array you have to use [n] instead of [n-1]. What? Yes you have understood perfectly...we say enough to range errors!
<br>
<br>What can I do? You can do whatever you want. This class template provides all common methods like: size, front, back, at and others. It provides iterators, exceptions for wrong indexing, and useful operator overloading. You can also initialize a real_array using initializer_list. Run examples.cpp to see some examples.

Note that jfet::real_array transfers its constness to the contained objects.
